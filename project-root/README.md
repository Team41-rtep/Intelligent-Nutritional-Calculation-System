## Project Overview

Intelligent-Nutritional-Calculation-System is a real-time embedded system that identifies fruits using a camera and a lightweight neural network model, measures their weight using a serial-connected weight sensor, and calculates their nutritional content instantly. It provides a visual and intuitive interface to help users monitor nutritional intake in daily life.

This project combines computer vision, serial communication, and nutrition analysis into a single user-friendly solution, running on a Raspberry Pi with real-time data acquisition and processing.

## Real-Time Requirements

To ensure responsive and interactive operation, the system is designed with the following real-time features:

Live video feed from a camera is captured and processed frame-by-frame for fruit classification using a TensorFlow Lite model.

Serial communication with a weight sensor is handled via a dedicated background thread, ensuring continuous data flow without blocking the main UI.

Real-time feedback is provided by overlaying predictions and nutritional information onto the live video stream using OpenCV.

Non-blocking execution is achieved through multithreading and event-driven architecture, avoiding delays or unresponsiveness in user interaction.
